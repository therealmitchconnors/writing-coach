Make my app have a clean and modern design that emphasizes simplicity and user-friendliness. Here are the specific details about its style, color scheme, and layout:

### Style
- **Minimalist Design**: The website uses a minimalist design approach with plenty of white space, making the content easy to read and navigate.
- **Typography**: The fonts are clean and modern, typically sans-serif, which enhances readability. The headings are bold and slightly larger, while the body text is kept at a comfortable reading size.

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**: The primary color scheme is dark mode.
- **Accent Colors**: Accent colors such as light gray and subtle shades of blue are used to highlight important elements and provide visual interest without overwhelming the user.
- **Contrast**: High contrast is maintained between text and background to ensure readability. For example, white text on a dark background.

### Layout
- **Main Content Area**: The main content area is centered and uses a single-column layout for easy reading. Each section is clearly defined with ample spacing between them.
- **Sidebar**: There is no sidebar, which keeps the focus on the main content.

### User Interface Elements
- **Buttons**: Buttons are styled with rounded corners and use the primary blue color. They change color slightly on hover to indicate interactivity.
- **Forms**: Forms are clean and straightforward, with clear labels and ample spacing between fields. Input fields have a light border and change color when focused.
- **Links**: Links are underlined and use the primary blue color. They change color on hover to indicate they are clickable.
